# Project Veridium1
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/projectveridium1

`Project Veridium1` is a synchronous online multiplayer virtual world game prototyped and developed by `Rob Kopp` and `Nate Kemavaha` starting at the end of 2010 to the beginning of 2011. 
The project entered a (college-students) game developer competition in Feb of 2011 and was one of the ten final contestants.

One-liner description
==
* Think of it as `Risks` and `FarmVille` combined. But better than `FarmVille` because it is actually synchronous. 

Requirement
==
* ActionScript3
* Flash plugin on browser
* LAMP stack for backend server

How things work?
==

Backend
==
* Require LAMP stack on a Linux server.
* Admin access to a network router in order to reconfigure port-forwarding so that the outside world can connect to your server.
* You'll need at least console/terminal to execute php script and get it running in the background. This php script is essentially processing a received payload (aka game-specific messages) and determining what to do (i.e. create, update MYSQL).
* Nowadays you can use cloud to run a game server 24/7. 
* Back in 2010/2011, you'd run it from your basement or apartment 24/7, hoping your roommates wouldn't accidentally trip on those ethernet wires plugged to your server.

Frontend
==
* You'll need a browser with Flash plugin installed and enabled. 
* WARNING: Nowdays Flash is pretty much dead. Back in 2011, it was still a big thing (hundreds millions of dollar business).

It is one of the projects that has given me (`Nate Kemavaha`) the greatest sense of accomplishment.
It was one of the large-scale reverse engineerings I'd done as a small guy back then.
