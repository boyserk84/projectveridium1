= Building a building on a city. =

All advanced city gameplay mechanic and user interface will be implemented on this iteration.

Note:

Timer (Count-Down) is used for measuring how long it would take to build each building. Once the building is done constructed, the flag will set and give out a permission to requirement list in the city.
For the building type that increases city's capacity, the flag will set out and cap(s) is updated immediately.
