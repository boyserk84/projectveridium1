= Iteration#4 =
We will deal with contents and logic within a game.

- Battlefield gameplay (how to determine winner and looser)

- Allocation and deallocation of different type of soldiers

- Allocation and deallocation of different type of workers

- Resources distribution and reproduction within a period of time

- Timer and how often you get resources (5 minutes)

= Design on soldiers allocation =

Approach#1 Upgrade soldiers in a progressional manner 

All soldiers will initially have a "level#1" status, so called "minute-man". Then you can allocate a certain amount of "level#1" soldiers to "level#2". Let's say we have x amount of "level#2" soldiers after the upgrade. Then to be able to upgrade soldiers to "level#3", we can only upgrade for x amount, which is the amount of "level#2" soldiers. Basically, each soldier must be going through level#1 and so on before reaching the highest level.

Approach#2 Command and Conquer soldiers allocation style
Basically, once certain type of buildings is built, a certain type of soliders is enabled to be trained/drafted. For instance, "barrack" allows a player to train a minute-man. Once, "forge" is built, the player can train a higher level soldier immediately without having soldiers been through "minute-man" status like approach#1.

= Enable soldiers to be able to be upgraded =

To be able to upgrade soldiers, each player must build certain types of buildings. Some higher level buildings will enable each player to train soldiers to higher level. 

= Battlefield algorithm/formula =
Defenders who will die during the battle field
is equal to || (# of attackers) x ( (# of attackers) x attack value ) / (# of defenders x defense value) ||
