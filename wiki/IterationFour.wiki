= Design on soldiers allocation =

= Upgrade soldiers in a progressional manner =

All soldiers will initially have a "level#1" status, so called "minute-man". Then you can allocate a certain amount of "level#1" soldiers to "level#2". Let's say we have x amount of "level#2" soldiers after the upgrade. Then to be able to upgrade soldiers to "level#3", we can only upgrade for x amount, which is the amount of "level#2" soldiers. Basically, each soldier must be going through level#1 and so on before reaching the highest level.

= Enable soldiers to be able to be upgraded =

To be able to upgrade soldiers, each player must build certain types of buildings. Some higher level buildings will enable each player to train soldiers to higher level.
